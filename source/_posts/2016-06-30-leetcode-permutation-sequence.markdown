The set [1,2,3,â€¦,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order,

We get the following sequence (ie, for n = 3):

```
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
```

Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.

#### Note
Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.

### Solution
* The first digit is k/(n-1)!, then let k = k % (n-1)! and remove this digit from num. 
* The second digit is k/(n-2)!, then let k = k % (n-2)! and remove this digit from num and so on.
