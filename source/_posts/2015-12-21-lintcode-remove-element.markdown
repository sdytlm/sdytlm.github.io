### Remove Element

Given an array and a value, remove all occurrences of that value in place and return the new length.

The order of elements can be changed, and the elements after the new length don't matter.

#### Example
Given an array [0,4,4,0,0,2,4,4], value=4

return 4 and front four elements of the array is [0,0,0,2]

#### Note
1. Return the length of new array `A`
2. Don't create another container
