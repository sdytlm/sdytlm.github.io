Reverse digits of an integer.

* Example1: x = 123, return 321
* Example2: x = -123, return -321


#### Note
* Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!

* If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.

* Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?

* For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.
