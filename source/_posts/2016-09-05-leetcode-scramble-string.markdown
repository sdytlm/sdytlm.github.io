Given a string s1, we may represent it as a binary tree by partitioning it to two non-empty substrings recursively.

Below is one possible representation of s1 = "great":
```
    great
   /    \
  gr    eat
 / \    /  \
g   r  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
To scramble the string, we may choose any non-leaf node and swap its two children.

For example, if we choose the node "gr" and swap its two children, it produces a scrambled string "rgeat".

```
    rgeat
   /    \
  rg    eat
 / \    /  \
r   g  e   at
           / \
          a   t
```
We say that "rgeat" is a scrambled string of "great".

Similarly, if we continue to swap the children of nodes "eat" and "at", it produces a scrambled string "rgtae".
```
    rgtae
   /    \
  rg    tae
 / \    /  \
r   g  ta  e
       / \
      t   a
```
We say that "rgtae" is a scrambled string of "great".

Given two strings s1 and s2 of the same length, determine if s2 is a scrambled string of s1.

### Solution

s1和s2是scramble的话，那么必然存在一个在s1上的长度l1，将s1分成s11和s12两段，同样有s21和s22。
* 那么要么s11和s21是scramble的并且s12和s22是scramble的
* 要么s11和s22是scramble的并且s12和s21是scramble的
