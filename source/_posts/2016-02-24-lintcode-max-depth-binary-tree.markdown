### Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

#### Example
Given a binary tree as follow:

```
  1
 / \ 
2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

The maximum depth is 3.
